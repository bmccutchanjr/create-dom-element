# Create DOM Element

Create DOM Element is intended as a front-end utility script to aid in the creation and configuration of HTML DOM elements on a web page.  It consists of a single JavaScript function.

To use it, include a script tag in your HTML with this URL as 'src'.

	<script src="https://ww.github.com/bmmcutchanjr/create-dom-elememt/crateDOMElememt.js">

Honetly don't know if this has any real value.  The code to create and configure an element is pretty repetitous, but so are the parameters for this function.  It may have some value in promoting DRY code, though.
